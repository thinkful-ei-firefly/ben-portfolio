      <h2>About Me</h2>
      <p>I'm Ben Rosen and I'm a current Engineering Immersion student at Thinkful. I came to programming through my background as a musician, discovering Lilypond for typsetting music (which compiles text-based input similar to LaTex) and Supercollider, an Object Oriented Programming language that can be used to generate and process sound in real-time. I quickly became hooked, enjoying the thrill of solving problems and seeing the creative potential that mastering programming techniques has to offer. While continuing to explore audio programming, I have expanded my explorations to include HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery, and other web development technologies.</p>

        <h3>Buffy Trivia Quiz</h3>
        <p>This app allows a user to test their trivia knowledge about the TV show Buffy The Vampire Slayer. The app randomly loads 5 questions from a pool of 10, and randomizes the order of the answer choices as well. It checks user answer choices to see if they are correct, gives the appropriate feedback, and keeps a running score in addition to displaying the current question number. At the end, a user can choose to re-take the quiz.</p>
        <p>Technologies used: HTML5, CSS, JavaScript, JQuery</p>
